Since "Male" and "Female" are unordered (or nominal) factor levels, 
R returns a warning message, telling you that the greater than operator is not meaningful. As seen before,
R attaches an equal value to the levels for such factors.

But this is not always the case! Sometimes you will also deal with factors 
that do have a natural ordering between its categories. If this is the case, 
we have to make sure that we pass this information to Râ€¦

Let us say that you are leading a research team of five data analysts and 
that you want to evaluate their performance. To do this, you track their speed, 
evaluate each analyst as "slow", "fast" or "insane", and save the results in speed_vector.

As a first step, assign speed_vector knowing that:

Analyst 1 is fast,
Analyst 2 is slow,
Analyst 3 is slow,
Analyst 4 is fast and
Analyst 5 is insane.
No need to specify these are factors yet.

Scripts:

# Create speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("fast","slow","slow","fast","insane")

Result:
> # Create speed_vector
> speed_vector <- c("fast","slow","slow","fast","insane")
> speed_vector
[1] "fast"   "slow"   "slow"   "fast"   "insane"
